# The Strategy Pattern

## Definition
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Key Concepts
* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate (encapsulate) them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation since it is way more flexible.
* Favor composition over inheritance
