# The Template Method Pattern

## Definition
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.

## Key Concepts
* **The Hollywood Principle**: Don't call us, we'll call you. High-level components should determine when low-level components are needed and therefore use them.
