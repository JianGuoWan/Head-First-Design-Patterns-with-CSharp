# The Iterator and Composite Patterns

## Definitions
* **The Iterator Pattern** provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
* **The Composite Pattern** allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Key Concepts
* **The Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should only have one reason to change.
